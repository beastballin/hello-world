# hello-world
Starting to learn coding with zero prior knowledge. May god have mercy on my soul.
Took a class in highschool about website development. Was overwhelmed. If coding is anything like that (which I'm sure it is), I can only hope time and age has better prepared me for the career I've chosen to do: Game Development/Programming.
